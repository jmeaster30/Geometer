A Geometry Modeling Thingy

I had this idea when I was in my geometry class in college where we had to draw out our problems and this helped us solve them.
However, there was this one problem that broke my brain. We were given an image of a geometric construction and we had to figure out why the conclusion of the construction was wrong. The issue was in how it was drawn. The image we received showed this one angle as less than another angle yet if you went through the problem by hand you would find that angle was always greater than the other angle. Also in college, I took a class on the theory of computation and I had a project on automated theorem solvers and logic programming.

So from those two inspirations, I had the idea of a program that let you build geometric models and query them to learn stuff about the model. My goal in this project is to be able to pick some problems from my copy of Euclid's The Elements and solve them.
